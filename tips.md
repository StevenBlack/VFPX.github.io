## Information for Project Managers  

### Migrating from CodePlex

If you currently have a VFPX project on CodePlex, we have [detailed instructions](/migrating/index.html) to migrate it to GitHub.

### Tips

**Note: this rest of this page is out-dated and has to be updated for GitHub**

This is a work in progress so feel free to add your own notes or comments that you believe will helpful to other project managers on VFPX

*   **Update the Wiki page for your project**: Important information to include would be
    *   Your name and contact information
    *   A brief description of your project
    *   Instructions on how to join the project
*   **Use 2 different projects**: One for distribution and one for source control. If you distribute your source control project, any one who downloads your project for evaluation will get a prompt to log in to source control.
*   **Prefix your checkins with the project name**: Every checkin is listed under the Source Code tab. It is very helpful to show the project that the checkin applies to.
*   **Prefix your work items with the project name**: Even though you can filter work items by project. It is nice to see, at a glance, what project the work item belongs to.
*   **Prefix your discussion threads with the project name**: This allows discussions to be easily identified by project.
