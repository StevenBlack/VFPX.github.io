**A Visual FoxPro Community effort to create open source add-ons for Visual FoxPro 9.0**

![](hr-g.png)

The code, classes, and libraries made available here are the result of a community-based effort to support and extend Visual FoxPro. Anyone can join-in, help and propose new VFPX projects for possible inclusion in the effort. VFPX members are fans of FoxPro and they give generously of their time, resources, and ideas to make VFPX possible. A debt of gratitude is owed to everyone that has participated or otherwise contributed to VFPX. Thank you.

### ![scroll.png](scroll.png) Licensing

The projects presented here were donated to VFPX by contributors, developed by VFPX members, or included as part of Microsoft's efforts to share the source of certain VFP product components with the VFP Community. All of the projects here are governed by the [Shared Source License for VFPX](license.md) unless otherwise stated or noted in a project's source code/documentation.

#UPDATE THIS SECTION# The project proposal process is fairly simple and designed to reduce administrative overhead for all involved. All you have to do us fill out a two page [VFPX Project Proposal](releases/view/8433) which provides the VFPX Administrators information needed to determine if the project fits into VFPX. Once you fill out the proposal, send the document to: projects AT vfpx DOT org.  

The administrators will review the proposal and let you know if it will be included or not included. The review process time varies depending on how busy the administrators are when you submit the proposal. After all, they all have day jobs too, just like you. You can review the [Project Manager Acceptance Outline](/wikipage?title=Project%20Manager%20Acceptance%20Outline&referringTitle=Home) to understand what happens once a project is accepted and [Tips For Project Managers](/wikipage?title=Tips%20For%20Project%20Managers&referringTitle=Home) to gain some helpful tips in working with CodePlex.

### ![getinvolved.png](getinvolved.png) Get Involved

VFPX is a volunteer effort in need of project managers, designers, developers, documentation specialists, testers, sales people, marketing, and visionaries. Determine how you can help and get involved. Plainly put, this is a significant part of the future of Visual FoxPro. You can decide if you are going to sit by and watch, or get involved. The more people who participate in this effort, the less each of us has to work to make it a success. Help [get the word out](promote.md)!  

If you want to get involved on one or more of the many projects included in VFPX, contact the project manager and let them know you are interested in helping out. The project manager knows resources required and roles needed on the project. You work with the project manager to determine the role you will play. The project manager will work with the VFPX administrators to get your CodePlex login added as a developer.
